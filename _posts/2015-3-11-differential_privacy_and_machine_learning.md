As a begining of my research, I survey the topics on differential privacy and machine learning. The basic structure of this slide is arised from [1].

Some very important topics in differential privacy machine learning containing in 

1. The local sensitivity and smooth sensitivity.

3. The relationship of differential privacy with learning theory.

is not covered in this slides.
