Savage's approach to research, via Mosteller（copy from Jon McAuliffe's and Jun Liu’s webpage):

- As soon as a problem is stated, start right away to solve it. Use simple examples.
- Keep starting from **first principles**, explaining again and again what you are trying to do.
- **Believe** that this problem can be solved and that you will enjoy working it out.
- Don't be hampered by the original problem statement. Try other problems in its neighborhood; maybe there is a better problem than yours.
- Work an hour or so on it frequently. Talk about it; explain it to people.
